  id="" item-title="" position="right" media-caption="">On 24 February 2022, the
  Russian armed forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. As a result
  of this unprovoked and unjustified aggression, substantial areas of the
  Ukrainian territory now constitute areas of war from which many persons are
  fleeing.The EU stands united in its unwavering support to Ukraine and has
  stepped up its political, humanitarian, financial and military support to the
  country. The European Commission is also closely cooperating with Ukraine's
  neighbouring countries to support them in providing protection for people
  fleeing the invasion.</ecl-featured-item>&nbsp;<ecl-spacing breakpoint=""

This has been in the form of macro-financial assistance, budget support, emergency assistance, crisis response and humanitarian aid. In addition, military assistance measures are around €15 billion, of which €5.6 billion have been mobilised under the European Peace Facility. This brings the total support made available so far to Ukraine since the beginning of Russia's aggression to around €53 billion. Together with the resources made available to help Member States cater for needs of Ukrainians fleeing the war in the EU, the overall support to Ukraine and Ukrainians amounts to around €70 billion. As part of the commitment made during the College-to-Government meeting and the EU-Ukraine Summit, €1 billion of EU support will be mobilised for Ukraine’s fast recovery. This is to be financed through Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation (NDICI) and European Investment Bank (EIB) loans. €37.8 billionmade available by Team Europe Pie chart with 7 slices.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>View as data table, €37.8 billionmade available by Team Europe</ecl-text><ecl-text tag="h2" theme="ec" is-bold="true" level="2" size="m" item-id="humanitarian-aid-and-civil-protection" slot="">Humanitarian aid and civil protection</ecl-text><ecl-text tag="p" theme="ec" is-bold="false" level="2" size="m" slot="">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
